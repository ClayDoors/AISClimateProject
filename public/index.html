            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="decorative-box">
                <p>One of the main problems in today’s society is climate change. Out of all the problems in
                    climate change, arguably the biggest factor that increases it is the carbon footprint released when
                    transporting products through different types of vehicles. Some of the biggest postal services in
                    the world, like FedEx, USPS, and UPS, constantly release tons of Carbon Dioxide emissions
                    every day. While it may be impossible to find that number, it is possible to find how much
                    carbon dioxide emissions your order releases when ordering from FedEx, USPS, or UPS.</p>
                <p>EcoTrack, our newly designed and state of the art programmed website, allows us to see
                    this. EcoTrack takes in multiple variables, including the type of postal service, the transportation
                    type, the vehicle model, and the distance. Then, it calculates the carbon dioxide emissions
                    released by that product. It does this through the built in code we made mixed special APIS
                    relating to the variables needed in order to calculate the numbers. The numbers will shock you,
                    which is why there's also a tab that shows you how to decrease carbon dioxide not just through
                    ordering, but in all sorts of ways. EcoTrack helps show anyone who orders products online
                    (using FedEx, USPS, or UPS) the unfortunate harm their products cause to the environment,
                    which is why it’s so unique.While there are many websites that tell their audience the harm
                    transporting products causes on the environment, EcoTrack takes their personal order
                    details(inputted by the user) to demonstrate the harm on the environment.</p>
                <p>If nothing changes, carbon dioxide emissions will only get worse as time goes on.
                    According to “Ourworldindata”, transportation accounts for around 24% of US Greenhouse gas
                    emissions. Out of that 24%, around 53% comes from shipping these products, with trucks and
                    lorries accounting for almost 30% (Ritchie, 2020).</p>
                <p>Most people do not understand how much carbon dioxide emissions their orders release,
                    even if their products are being transported in their state. By creating a website in which people
                    can understand how much carbon dioxide emissions their order releases while also providing
                    solutions on how to reduce their carbon footprint, we can help reduce the overall carbon
                    emissions produced on this earth.</p>

                <p>Our website has the potential to form a huge positive impact on society. It would help in
                    solving a global issue on the overall topic of climate change. This would function by informing
                    people of the devastating carbon footprint postal services release when transporting items.
                    Whether it's huge companies like Amazon, Ebay or something as small as your town mailman all
                    these transportation companies release a form of carbon emission. This is heavily relevant in
                    today's day and age due to the increase in accessibility of ordering items online. Due to this, our
                    website helps to emphasize the urgency of this topic, by showing the carbon emissions which are
                    released into the environment.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, our topic will never be irrelevant or lose its importance due to carbon
                    dioxide emissions only getting worse as time goes on, and a huge part of these emissions come
                    from transporting products through different types of vehicles such as cargo planes, vans, and 18
                    wheelers. However, with the knowledge of how much emissions an order/transportation method
                    is releasing, society will be influenced to push towards more stable and less harmful forms of
                    transportation. Thus leading to impacting the overall carbon emissions on a global scale by
                    aiming to change how items are transported.</p>

            <h2>Price</h2>
            <div class="decorative-box">
                <p>Our estimated budget costs run at $94 per month for various services and server upkeep.
                    We estimated this on a maximum of 10,000 carbon calculation requests per month. We estimate
                    that website hosting through render will be $19 to start + $25 for our actual website hosting. Our
                    carbon interface calculations will use the startup option which will run $30 per month. Our
                    Google Maps calculation requests will cost .2 cents per request estimating that it will cost $20
                    per month with 10,000 calculations. Therefore, our final upkeep costs will be ~$94 per month.
                    After we have enough traction on our website we will be able to run ads on the website to ensure
                    a stable income to help pay for the upkeep. The ads won't be disruptive and will at most be on
                    the side of the page. With the maximum amount of ads being seen on the page at one time being
                    2. Furthermore, we are going to incorporate a donation area where users can pay for having ads
                    removed and help maintain the website.</p>
